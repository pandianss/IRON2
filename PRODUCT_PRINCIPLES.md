# 1. Authority before experience

No screen, feature, or flow is valid unless it enforces an institutional rule.

---

# 2. Standing is the product

Everything the user can see, do, or become derives from Standing.

If Standing does not justify it, it does not exist.

# 3. Time is governed

A day inside IRON is an institutional object.

It opens.
It produces obligation.
It must close.

There is no passive time.

---

# 4. Irreversibility is required

Progress must accumulate.
Failure must scar.
History must outlive motivation.

---

# 5. Retention is not a feature

Retention emerges from:

* contracts
* escalating consequence
* permanent memory
* narrowing paths under risk

Any system that relies on encouragement has failed.
