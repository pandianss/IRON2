# The IRON Roles Charter

**Layer: Civil / Social**
**Status: DRAFT**
**Dependency: Social Capital Constitution**

This document defines the social hierarchy, function, and authority of every human actor within IRON.
Roles are not badges. They are offices held within the institution.

## I. The Role Hierarchy

### 1. Participant (The Citizen)
*The fundamental unit of the system.*
- **Definition**: Any user with an active `BehavioralLedger`.
- **Power Source**: Verified Existence (Identity).
- **Formal Powers**:
    - Right of Inspection (Self).
    - Right of Appeal (Court).
    - Right to Witness (Peer validation).
- **Obligations**:
    - `BehavioralHonesty`.
    - `PeriodicCheckIn`.
- **Decay**: Dormancy leads to `FROZEN` status (Loss of Rights).

### 2. Witness (The Validator)
*The eyes of the system.*
- **Definition**: A Participant who actively validates the effort of others.
- **Power Source**: Presence.
- **Formal Powers**:
    - `Vouch`: Grants `SocialCapital` to another user.
    - `Corroborate`: Supports an Appeal as evidence.
- **Obligations**:
    - Truthfulness (False witnessing burns Capital).
    - Responsiveness (Must verify within window).
- **Abuse Limit**: Cannot witness same user > 3x/week (Anti-Collusion).

### 3. Mentor (The Guide)
*The stabilizer of new momentum.*
- **Definition**: A user with >90 Days Momentum who adopts an `ONBOARDING` user.
- **Power Source**: Proven Resilience.
- **Formal Powers**:
    - `Sponsor`: Pays the entry cost for a Mentee if needed.
    - `Shield`: Can absorb one "Miss" for a Mentee (Momentum Transfer).
- **Obligations**:
    - Weekly engagement.
    - Successful graduation of Mentees.
- **Incentive**: Legacy Dividend (1% of Mentee's generated Social Capital).

### 4. Sentinel (The Guardian)
*The early warning system.*
- **Definition**: High-witness-count users who monitor community health.
- **Power Source**: Accuracy & Trust.
- **Formal Powers**:
    - `Flag`: Mark a user as "At Risk" (triggers System Intervention).
    - `Summon`: Call for "Urgent Support" from the Graph.
- **Obligations**:
    - Impartiality.
    - No direct enforcement (Sentinels warn, Systems enforce).
- **Decay**: Inactivity removes Sentinel status immediately.

### 5. Chronicler (The Interpreter)
*The memory of the institution.*
- **Definition**: Users who curate behavior patterns into narratives.
- **Power Source**: Narrative Credibility.
- **Formal Powers**:
    - `Annotate`: Add context to a Behavioral Ledger (e.g., "Injury Break").
    - `Summarize`: Prepare the "Case File" for the Court of Appeals.
- **Obligations**:
    - Neutrality.
    - Fact-based interpretation.

### 6. Steward (The Judge)
*The final human authority.*
- **Definition**: The Council. Long-term serving members (~1 Year+).
- **Power Source**: Deep Institutional Memory.
- **Formal Powers**:
    - `Rule`: Decide on contested Appeals.
    - `Pardon`: Grant "Social Mercy" (bypass Physics).
    - `Ban`: Exclude malicious actors.
- **Obligations**:
    - Consensus (Decisions require Quorum).
    - Transparency (All rulings must be written).
- **Term**: Rotating tenure to prevent oligarchy.

## II. The Architecture of Authority

### 1. Authority is Earned
No role is permanent.
- **Dynamic Tenure**: All roles (except Participant) decay if `ServiceRate` drops.
- **Capital Requirement**: Leading roles require specific `SocialCapital` deposits.

### 2. Authority is Checked
- **The Anti-Tyranny Clause**: 3 Witnesses can override 1 Sentinel.
- **The Appeal Clause**: Any Steward ruling can be appealed to the "General Assembly" (All Socialites) if high-stakes.

### 3. Authority is Service
- **The Cost of Power**: Higher roles pay higher `SC` taxes on failures.
- **The Burden**: Stewards and Sentinels must perform "Administrative Work" (Reviewing queues) to maintain status.
