# The IRON Roles & Rituals Framework

**Layer: Social / Institutional**
**Status: LIVING**

This framework translates the abstract laws of IRON (Physics, Rights, Justice) into lived human experience. It defines who people become and what they do together.

## I. ROLES (Who We Become)

Roles in IRON are earned, not assigned. They represent a user's function within the living institution.

### 1. The Witness
*The Fundamental Citizen.*
- **Function**: Validates the reality of another's effort.
- **Authority**: Their "Vouch" grants Social Capital.
- **Requirement**: Must have a non-zero `ConsistencyScore`.

### 2. The Sentinel
*The Guardian of Standards.*
- **Function**: Alerts the community to users at risk of fracture before the system intervenes.
- **Action**: Issues "Urgent Support" notifications to the Graph.
- **Requirement**: High `WitnessCount` (Active observer).

### 3. The Mentor
*The Guide of Continuity.*
- **Function**: Adopts new users (`ONBOARDING` state) to ensure they reach `MOMENTUM`.
- **Incentive**: Earns a "Legacy Dividend" (small % of Mentee's Social Capital).
- **Requirement**: `MOMENTUM` state > 90 days.

### 4. The Chronicler
*The Keeper of Narrative.*
- **Function**: Curates the "Case File" for appeals. Interprets the "Behavioral Ledger" into a human story.
- **Context**: "This wasn't laziness; look at the 14 days prior."
- **Requirement**: High `SocialCapital` (Trusted interpreter).

### 5. The Probation Guide
*The Officer of Return.*
- **Function**: Assigned to a user entering `PROBATION` or `RECOVERING` phases.
- **Duty**: Must countersign every check-in for 7 days to validate return.
- **Requirement**: Voluntarily accepts the burden.

### 6. The Resurrection Sponsor
*The Patron of Mercy.*
- **Function**: Pays the `SocialCapital` cost for a bankrupt user to re-enter.
- **Risk**: If the sponsored user fails again, the Sponsor loses their investment.
- **Requirement**: "Wealthy" Socialite.

## II. RITUALS (What We Do)

Rituals are formalized social processes that mark transitions in state. They prevent change from feeling mechanical.

### 1. The Service Oath (Entry)
- **Trigger**: First check-in.
- **Action**: User explicitly accepts the `USER_COVENANT`.
- **Meaning**: "I am not just using an app; I am entering a discipline."

### 2. The First Fracture (Crisis)
- **Trigger**: First time a streak breaks.
- **Ritual**: System pauses. No generic "Oops" screen. User must "Acknowledge the Break" and write a 1-line "Reason for Record".
- **Meaning**: Failure is formalized, not swept under the rug.

### 3. The Momentum Mark (Status)
- **Trigger**: Crossing 21, 90, 365 days.
- **Ritual**: The `Badge` is not just awarded; it is "Witnessed" by 3 peers.
- **Meaning**: Achievement is social, not solitary.

### 4. The Social Trial (Justice)
- **Trigger**: A contested Appeal.
- **Ritual**: A Jury of 5 random `Sentinels` is summoned. They review the `Chronicler's` summary. They vote (Jury Nullification allowed).
- **Meaning**: The Community interprets the Law.

### 5. The Return Ceremony (Redemption)
- **Trigger**: Completing `RECOVERING` phase and re-entering `ENGAGED`.
- **Ritual**: The "Grey" state lifts. The Sponsor is notified. The user "Rings the Bell" (Global low-priority notification).
- **Meaning**: You made it back. You are one of us again.

### 6. The Year Reset (Renewal)
- **Trigger**: Day 365.
- **Ritual**: The Ledger is sealed (Archived). The Counter resets (optionally). The Identity remains.
- **Meaning**: We finish the cycle. We start again.
