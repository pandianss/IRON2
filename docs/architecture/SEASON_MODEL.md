# The IRON Yearly Season Model

**Layer: Civil / Time**
**Status: DRAFT**
**Concept: "How Time Reshapes the World"**

IRON does not exist in a static loop. It breathes.
A "Season" is a global modifier on the Physics engine.

## I. The Annual Cycle

The year is not just 365 days. It is divided into 5 distinct seasons, each asking a different question of the Participant.

### 1. The Ascent (Jan - Mar)
*   **Theme**: Construction.
*   **Physics Modifier**: `Standard`.
*   **Social Modifier**: `Mentorship Bonus` (+10% SC for adoption).
*   **Goal**: Build the foundation. Establish the habit.

### 2. The Crucible (Apr - Jun)
*   **Theme**: Pressure.
*   **Physics Modifier**: `Strictness +10%` (Lapse windows tighten).
*   **Social Modifier**: `Witness Power +20%` (Community must hold the line).
*   **Goal**: Test the durability of the identity.

### 3. The Long Night (Jul - Sep)
*   **Theme**: Endurance.
*   **Physics Modifier**: `Decay Rate +20%` (Dormancy hits harder).
*   **Social Modifier**: `Resurrection Discount` (Cheaper to bring people back).
*   **Goal**: Survive the slump. Don't go dark.

### 4. The Reckoning (Oct - Nov)
*   **Theme**: Judgment.
*   **Physics Modifier**: `Standard`.
*   **Social Modifier**: `Appeal Cost +50%` (Forgiveness is expensive).
*   **Goal**: Finalize your standing. Pay your debts.

### 5. Renewal (Dec)
*   **Theme**: Forgiveness.
*   **Physics Modifier**: `Frozen`. (No penalties).
*   **Social Modifier**: `Reflection Mode` (Writing narrative summaries earns Legacy Status).
*   **Goal**: Close the book. Prepare for the Reset.

## II. The Reset Protocol (Year End)

On **Day 365 +/- 1**, the Great Clock ticks over.

### 1. What is Lost (The Clean Slate)
*   **Action Logic**: The daily `CheckIn` counter resets to 0.
*   **States**: All `FRACTURED`, `RECOVERING`, `AT_RISK` states cleared to `ONBOARDING` (or `ACTIVE` if verified).

### 2. What Remains (The Identity)
*   **Social Capital**: Carried over (capped at `Elite` limit).
*   **Roles**: Stewards and Sentinels retain office if active.
*   **Badges**: `Momentum Marks` are permanent.

### 3. The Archive (The Institutional Memory)
*   The `BehavioralLedger` for Year X is "Sealed".
*   It becomes a read-only artifact: "The Record of 2024".
*   It can never be changed again, even by Appeal.

## III. Global Events

The System can trigger non-seasonal events based on Aggregate Health.

### 1. The Rally (Low Morale)
*   *Trigger*: `GlobalChurn > 15%`.
*   *Effect*: `Witness Reward x2`.
*   *Narrative*: "The Community is fraying. Hold the line."

### 2. The Purge (High Corruption)
*   *Trigger*: `Inflation > 50%` (Too much SC).
*   *Effect*: `Decay Rate x2` for 7 days.
*   *Narrative*: "Hard Times create strong citizens."
