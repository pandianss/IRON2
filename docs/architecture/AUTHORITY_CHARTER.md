# The IRON Appeals, Authority & Mercy Charter

**Layer: Constitutional**
**Version: 1.0.0**
**Status: IMMUTABLE**

This document defines the interface between the System and Human Agency. It is the final check against tyranny.

## 1. The Right of Entry (Human-in-the-Loop)
The System is autonomous, but not sovereign.
- **The Loop**: Humans may enter the decision loop at any point where `SocialCapital` exceeds the `InterventionCost`.
- **The Override**: A consensus of 3 Witnesses (Social Authority) overrides any Algorithmic Judgment (Engine Authority), provided no invariants (Physics) are broken.

## 2. The Court of Appeals
The mechanism for challenging the Engine's judgment.
- **Standing**: Any user with `SocialCapital > 10` has standing to appeal.
- **Cost**: Appeals are paid for in Service (Social Capital). Mercy is not free; it is earned by helping others.
- **Finality**: A decision by the Court (System or Community Jury) is final and rewrites the State.

## 3. The Definition of Mercy
Mercy is the suspension of Physics for the sake of Morale.
- **System Mercy**: The engine may grant `PROBATION` instead of `FRACTURE` if the user has a high `ConsistencyScore` (History of Service).
- **Social Mercy**: The Community may grant `REDEMPTION` to a texturally-failed user if they believe the failure was circumstantial (e.g., "The Dog Ate My Phone" clause, verified by witnesses).

## 4. Prevention of Tyranny
To prevent the Engine from becoming a tyrant:
- **No Invisible Rules**: Every decision must cite a public Rule ID.
- **No Secret Penalties**: All decays and burns must be logged in the `BehavioralLedger`.
- **The Kill Switch**: If `SocialLoad > 80%` (The system is nagging more than peers are supporting), the Engine must degrade its strictness automatically.

## 5. Social Authority
Influence is derived from Contribution, not Status.
- **Witness Power**: A user who validates 100 workouts has more authority than a user with a 1000-day streak.
- **The Jury**: High-contribution users form the Jury Pool for disputed appeals.
