# The First 90 Days: Induction Journey

**Layer: Civil / Onboarding**
**Status: DRAFT**
**Concept: "Citizenship, not Retention"**

The first 90 days are not a funnel to maximize engagement.
They are a **Citizenship Process** designed to induce the user into the Institution.

## Phase I: Orientation (Days 1–14)
**Goal:** Legitimacy. "I am entering a governed world."

### 1. The Entry Rite (Day 0)
- **Action**: User signs the `USER_COVENANT`.
- **System**: Grants `ONBOARDING` state. Minting `SocialCapital` is disabled.
- **Narrative**: "You are a guest. Citizenship is earned."

### 2. The First Truth (Day 1-3)
- **Event**: User logs first action.
- **Narrative**: "Action witnessed. Physics allows momentum to persist for 24 hours.".
- **Constraint**: No strict penalties yet. Soft warnings only.

### 3. The First Witness (Day 7)
- **Event**: A `Mentor` or `Sentinel` validates the user's start.
- **Narrative**: "You are seen. 'Alice' has witnessed your entry."
- **Effect**: Unlocks `Participant` Role eligibility.

## Phase II: Identity Formation (Days 15–45)
**Goal:** Emotional Imprinting. "My behavior has weight."

### 4. The First Miss (The Reality Check)
- **Event**: User misses a day.
- **Action**: System triggers `FRACTURE_PROTOCOL` (Lite).
- **Narrative**: "Continuity broken. This is not a glitch. Acknowledge to proceed."
- **Lesson**: Failure is formal.

### 5. The First Recovery (Resilience)
- **Event**: User returns after a miss.
- **Action**: System grants `RECOVERING` state.
- **Narrative**: "Return accepted. 3 days of consistency required to restore Momentum."
- **Lesson**: Recovery is work.

### 6. The First Service (Day 30)
- **Event**: User is prompted to Witness another new user.
- **Action**: User clicks "Witness".
- **Effect**: First `SocialCapital` minted.
- **Lesson**: You have power.

## Phase III: Social Embedding (Days 46–90)
**Goal:** Attachment. "I am part of something."

### 7. The Momentum Mark (Day 60)
- **Event**: Consecutive consistency.
- **Ritual**: System issues `Momentum Mark`. 3 Peers validate it.
- **Narrative**: "Your discipline is now a public fact."

### 8. The Mentor Connection (Day 75)
- **Event**: User is offered a formal `Mentor` (if struggling) or asked to prepare for Mentorship (if excelling).
- **Narrative**: "The hierarchy is noticing you."

### 9. The Graduation (Day 90)
- **Event**: Completion of Induction.
- **Ritual**: User enters `MOMENTUM` state permanently (unless fractured).
- **Effect**: Full `SocialCapital` rights. Can become `Witness`.
- **Narrative**: "Induction complete. You are IRON."
