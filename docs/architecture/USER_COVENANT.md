# The IRON User Covenant

**Layer: Constitutional**
**Version: 1.0.0**
**Status: FOUNDATIONAL**
**Binding: All users, all systems, all interventions**

This Covenant defines the relationship between a Human and the IRON Institution.
By entering IRON, a user does not merely create an account — they enter a governed behavioral system.

This document expresses what IRON promises, what IRON demands, and what IRON protects.

## PREAMBLE — What IRON Is

IRON is not a tracker.
IRON is not a feed.
IRON is not a motivational app.

IRON is a behavioral institution designed to cultivate:
- consistency over intensity
- identity over outcomes
- recovery over perfection
- contribution over vanity
- legitimacy over engagement

IRON exists to help humans build durable personal disciplines inside a legible, just, and humane system.

## ARTICLE I — The Nature of Membership

### 1.1 Entry
By joining IRON, you become a **Participant**, not a customer.
- Your actions are not merely stored. They are interpreted.
- Your days are not merely counted. They are judged within a lawful system.

### 1.2 Identity
Within IRON, you hold a living identity composed of:
- your behavior
- your consistency
- your recoveries
- your service to others

This identity evolves.
It cannot be fabricated.
It cannot be bought.
It can be lost.
It can always be rebuilt.

## ARTICLE II — What IRON Promises

IRON makes the following non-negotiable commitments to every user.

### 2.1 Legibility
IRON will never change your state in silence.
Every major transition will be accompanied by:
- a reason
- a rule
- a narrative explanation

Your history will remain inspectable.
Your standing will remain visible.
Your debt will be calculable.

### 2.2 Redemption
No user is ever permanently exiled.
Dormancy is not expulsion.
Failure is not identity.

IRON guarantees:
- a defined path back
- a finite cost of return
- a recoverable future

You may fall arbitrarily low.
You may never be sealed out.

### 2.3 Due Process
IRON will not fracture your standing without warning.
Before any severe enforcement:
- risk must be declared
- notice must be given
- time must be provided

Lockout is not punishment.
It is protocol.

### 2.4 Earned Resilience
Momentum, once earned, is protected.
One bad day does not erase a built self.

IRON will always:
- degrade before it fractures
- warn before it intervenes
- prefer recovery over collapse

### 2.5 Human Preference
When possible, IRON will choose people over algorithms.
- Encouragement before enforcement.
- Witness before warning.
- Community before computation.

## ARTICLE III — What IRON Requires

IRON is not passive.
It is not neutral.
It is not optional once entered.

Membership carries obligations.

### 3.1 Behavioral Honesty
You agree that:
- actions you log represent real behavior
- interventions you receive represent system judgment
- identity is constructed through participation, not performance

Gaming the system degrades your standing.
Lying to IRON is lying to your own institutional memory.

### 3.2 Continuity
IRON is built on continuity.
You are not required to succeed.
You are required to return.

Recovery is not weakness.
Disappearance is.

### 3.3 Service
Power inside IRON is derived from contribution.
- Validation of others.
- Witnessing effort.
- Supporting recovery.

Your service:
- builds Social Capital
- earns authority
- funds mercy
- sustains legitimacy

A silent user is a weak citizen.
A serving user becomes part of the institution.

## ARTICLE IV — The Shape of Progress

IRON does not measure only streaks.
It measures:
- stability
- resilience
- recovery velocity
- service history
- identity continuity

Progress is not linear.
Progress is structural.

You will be recognized not only for:
- how long you last
but for
- how you fail
- how you return
- how you help others endure

## ARTICLE V — On Failure

Failure is expected.
IRON formally recognizes:
- missed days
- fractured streaks
- dormant periods
- restarts
- withdrawals

Failure does not eject you.
Failure repositions you.

Your standing after failure is not determined by shame.
It is determined by response.

## ARTICLE VI — On Governance

IRON governs.
This means:
- some actions are constrained
- some states are protected
- some transitions are forbidden
- some costs are enforced

These constraints exist to protect:
- fairness
- meaning
- identity
- community trust

IRON is not here to please you.
IRON is here to remain legitimate.

## ARTICLE VII — On Mercy and Appeal

IRON is autonomous, but not sovereign.
You may:
- challenge decisions
- summon witnesses
- seek probation
- petition redemption

Mercy exists.
But mercy is never free.
It is funded by:
- your service
- your history
- your social standing
- the judgment of the community

The system may bend.
The community may override.
The laws may not disappear.

## ARTICLE VIII — On Departure

Dormancy is not erasure.
Your history remains.
Your narrative remains.
Your identity is preserved in ledger.

If you return:
You do not start as nothing.
You return as someone with a past.

## ARTICLE IX — The Core Understanding

IRON does not promise motivation.
IRON does not promise success.
IRON does not promise ease.

IRON promises:
- a system that remembers
- a structure that resists self-deception
- a world where consistency has weight
- a community where service builds power
- a path where return is always possible

By entering IRON, you accept:
- to be measured,
- to be interpreted,
- to be governed,
- to be witnessed,
- to be allowed back.

## SIGNATURE CLAUSE

This Covenant binds:
- the Engine
- the Governors
- the Courts
- the Witnesses
- and the Architects themselves.

No feature may violate it.
No growth may bypass it.
No optimization may erode it.

IRON is not defined by what it can do.
IRON is defined by what it refuses to become.
