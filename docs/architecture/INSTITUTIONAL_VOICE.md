# The Institutional Voice

**Layer: Legibility / Culture**
**Status: DRAFT**
**Concept: "How IRON Speaks"**

IRON must sound like an Institution, not a startup.
It is: **Just, Precise, Humane, Inevitable.**

## I. Tone Guidelines

### 1. Be Precise, Not Cold
*   *Bad*: "Streak lost." (Cold)
*   *Bad*: "Oh no! You lost your streak 😢" (Cloying)
*   *Good*: "Continuity broken. 14 days archived. Restart available." (Precise)

### 2. Be Authoritative, Not Aggressive
*   *Bad*: "You failed to check in." (Aggressive)
*   *Good*: "No signal received. State transition: AT_RISK." (Authoritative)

### 3. Be Humane, Not Lenient
*   *Bad*: "It's okay, try again!" (Lenient)
*   *Good*: "Failure is expected. Return is required." (Humane)

## II. Vocabulary of Power

Use these specific terms to reinforce the reality of the system.

| Common Term | IRON Term | Why? |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **User** | **Participant** | Implies duty and active role. |
| **Points** | **Social Capital** | Implies value and scarcity. |
| **Admin** | **Steward** | Implies service, not ownership. |
| **Ban** | **Exile** | Implies loss of citizenship. |
| **Bug** | **Anomaly** | Maintains diegetic consistency. |
| **Success** | **Momentum** | Focuses on movement, not end state. |
| **Retry** | **Resurrection** | High stakes. High effort. |

## III. The Privacy of Silence

IRON speaks clearly when necessary, but respects silence.
*   **No "Growth Hacking"**: IRON never asks you to invite friends to "unlock" features.
*   **No "Engagement Bait"**: IRON never notifies you just to get you to open the app.
*   **The Only Notification**: Interventions (Risk, Decay, Appeal). Everything else waits for you.
