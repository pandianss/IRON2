# IRON exists to become a personal institution.

Not a tracker.
Not a motivator.
Not a wellness platform.

An authority layer between intention and behaviour.

IRON’s long‑term role is to provide individuals with something modern life removed:

A system that remembers, evaluates, and holds them to account.

Success for IRON is not daily active users.

Success is the existence of long, continuous behavioural histories that cannot be faked, gamed, or erased.

IRON is built for the decade horizon, not the app store horizon.
