# IRON – Product Vision

IRON exists to solve one of the biggest silent problems in fitness:  
**people don’t fail because they lack information — they fail because they lose consistency.**

Fitness is not a knowledge problem.  
It is a **behavioral and social problem**.

## Why IRON?

Most fitness apps:
- Track data
- Count calories
- Log workouts

But they fail to answer:
> *Who keeps me going when motivation fades?*

IRON’s answer is **people**.

## Long-Term Goal

To become:
- The default social layer for fitness
- A trusted community for health-first lifestyles
- A platform where fitness is reinforced daily through interaction

---

## What Success Looks Like

- Users stay active for **years**, not weeks
- Communities form around gyms, cities, and goals
- Trainers grow sustainable digital followings
- Fitness becomes part of identity, not obligation

---

## Non-Negotiables

- Positive, non-toxic community
- Health-first over aesthetics-first
- Consistency over extremes
- Long-term engagement over vanity metrics
