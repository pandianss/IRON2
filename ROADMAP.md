This roadmap is institutional, not feature‑based.

---

## Phase 1 — Authority formation

* Standing Engine implemented
* Ledger replay deterministic
* Invariants enforced

Deliverable: behavioural law exists independent of UI.

---

## Phase 2 — Experience collapse

* App reduced to a single governed daily flow
* Navigation removed
* Standing selects all surfaces

Deliverable: the product can no longer be browsed.

---

## Phase 3 — Irreversibility

* eras
* scars
* recovery systems
* permanent violation records

Deliverable: failure becomes institutionally meaningful.

---

## Phase 4 — Escalation

* commitment ratcheting
* institutional ranks
* higher‑order contracts

Deliverable: long‑standing members have more to lose.

---

## Phase 5 — Institutional depth

* multi‑contract governance
* role systems
* extended behavioural domains

Deliverable: IRON becomes a general discipline system, not a fitness product.
