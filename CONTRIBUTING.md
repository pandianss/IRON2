# Contribution law

IRON is not an open feature playground.

Every contribution must strengthen institutional authority.

---

## All pull requests must answer

1. What rule does this enforce?
2. What behaviour does this govern?
3. What irreversible fact does this produce?
4. How does this deepen Standing?

If these cannot be answered clearly, the change is rejected.

---

## Forbidden contributions

* motivational UI
* cosmetic progress systems
* parallel behaviour logic outside institution/
* features that bypass Standing

---

## Required engineering discipline

* Standing Engine logic is unit‑tested.
* Ledger replay is deterministic.
* No UI component interprets behaviour.
* Invariants are enforced at system boundaries.
