# IRON 🏋️‍♂️  
**A social fitness platform built to keep health a lifelong priority**

IRON is a community-driven social media platform designed to connect **fitness enthusiasts, trainers, and gym partners** with a single goal:  
**to keep people consistently engaged in their fitness journey and reduce long-term attrition.**

Unlike traditional fitness apps that focus only on workouts or tracking, IRON focuses on **human connection, accountability, and motivation** — the key reasons people stay committed over time.

## 🚀 Vision

To build a highly active, positive global community where **health and fitness become a natural priority**, supported by peers, mentors, and shared goals.

IRON aims to transform fitness from a short-term resolution into a **sustainable lifestyle**.

## 🎯 Problem We Solve

Most people:
- Start fitness programs with motivation  
- Lose consistency within weeks or months  
- Drop out due to lack of accountability, support, or social reinforcement  

**Attrition is the real enemy of fitness.**

IRON directly addresses this by creating:
- Social accountability  
- Community engagement  
- Continuous motivation through interaction

## 🧠 Core Philosophy

> *People stay consistent when they feel seen, supported, and accountable.*

IRON is built around:
- Community > Isolation  
- Engagement > Tracking  
- Motivation > Guilt  
- Consistency > Intensity

## 🏗 Structural Philosophy
This repository is organized around **retention and consistency**.
Daily behavior (check-ins, streaks) and user identity are treated as **first-class domains**, not just features.
New code should land in `src/features/streak` or `src/identity` if it reinforces habit formation.
Generic code belongs in `src/infrastructure` or `src/app`.
