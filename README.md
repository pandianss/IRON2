# IRON

IRON is not a fitness application.

IRON is a behavioural institution.

Its purpose is to convert intention into sustained behaviour through enforceable commitments, permanent records, and governed daily obligation.

IRON operates on three foundations:

* a sovereign Behavioural Ledger
* a Standing State Machine
* a governed daily execution loop

The product does not offer features.
It enforces Standing.

## What IRON actually does

IRON establishes a contract with the user.

From that moment forward:

* each day becomes an institutional unit
* obligations are generated and enforced
* actions are recorded as permanent fact
* standing is continuously evaluated
* failure produces irreversible history

The user does not browse IRON.
They enter it.

## Architectural spine

IRON is organised around law, not screens.

```
institution/     → authority, rules, state machines
experience/      → the five governed system surfaces
interface/       → visual components only
infrastructure/  → storage, time, transport
```

UI consumes institutional truth.
It never creates it.

## Non‑negotiables

* Standing is sovereign.
* The ledger is the only source of truth.
* Every day must close.
* Breach creates permanent record.
* Retention emerges from governance, not motivation.
