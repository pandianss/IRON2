# IRON 🏋️‍♂️  
**A social fitness platform built to keep health a lifelong priority**

IRON is a community-driven social media platform designed to connect **fitness enthusiasts, trainers, and gym partners** with a single goal:  
**to keep people consistently engaged in their fitness journey and reduce long-term attrition.**

Unlike traditional fitness apps that focus only on workouts or tracking, IRON focuses on **human connection, accountability, and motivation** — the key reasons people stay committed over time.

- Community engagement  
- Continuous motivation through interaction
